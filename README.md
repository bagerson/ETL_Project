Proposal:

This project will design a database which contains data related to crime rates and the issuance of business licenses in New York City.

This project will rely on two datasets drawn from NYC Open Data


### [NYPD Complaint Data Historic 2006-2017](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i)


### [Legally Operating Businesses](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Legally-Operating-Businesses/w7w3-xahh)


The purpose of this project is to build a database which will hold New York City crime statistics and New York City business openings. That way the end user would be able to easily extract and analyze information related to the impact of crime on business development.

Suggested data columns are

Crime
* Date of Report
* Offesnse Description
* Police Report Description
* Borough
* Lat
* Long

Business Licenses
* Date of License Creation
* Industry
* Address
* Lat
* Long
